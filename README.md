# Scribe

The Scribe app is a part of the Charges "Sign your Mortgage" service. It
provides the document signing functions that the service needs to create a
legally binding digital signature.

Currently for Alpha the Scribe will perform signatures itself. By Live our plan
is for the Scribe to handoff document signing to a Hardware Security Module,
acting as a facade over this hardware.
